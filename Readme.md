#Simplex Solver

##Test Instructions

1. Download the project (using Donwload ZIP or Clone)
2. Start the file index.html in Google Chrome
3. Input Linear Problems (if anything is not straight forward here, please report the issue on GitHub)
4. Use `Start Solve` and `Step Solve` to see the problem iterate through until complete (if anything is not straight forward or incorrect here, please report the issue on GitHub)


##Notes:

Please document your problems with as much detail as possible (you can attach pictures, etc). 

#Goal:
After testing and tweaking it is my hopes that this program can be an aide for teaching/learning the Simplex Algorithm.
